every sound channel seems to have a structure like:
FFFFFFFF
00004000 or 00000000 or 00010000
volume
volume copy
0
0
0
1 volume again?
0
0
0
0
there seem to be several channels enabled but not used, maybe because I turned off music
setting volume negative is weird, it becomes very loud and dings?
maybe it's inverting volume of disabled effects?
for global it's just silent

code at 80270AE8, 80270AF0 reads these with offset 0x5D4 but from bases 803BD180, 803BD1B0 which are < 0x5D4 apart, so they don't seem to be fields of an object of that size.

803398b0 controller inputs
803a32c8 set to 0101 to become Fox
	as Krystal it's 0001 so maybe only first byte matters
803428f8 Y velocity
803a33ab u16 staff upgrades
803a32a8 u8 current health, max health (4 = 1 heart)
803a32b0 u8 money or something
803a32ac u8 set to 1 to enable Sharpclaw Disguise
	using it as Krystal turns you back into Fox but keeps her voice
803a336a something to do with camera - set above 7F to pan somewhere else
803a32c4 save file name
803a32d0 some item unlocks

80270ae8 code that reads global volume (from R4 + 0x5D4)
R4 values:
803bd360 - global volume
803bd210 - does look like volume for something (in fact it's wind effect)

`(*809F4038) + 0x81A` should be the voice flag (16-bit)
but this address might not be constant (it's not)
    I think it's field 0xB8 in the Player object
    and Krystal's voice is indeed loaded, but changing this doesn't fix the animations

80270af0 code that reads SFX volume (from R3 + 0x5D4)
R3 values:
803bd1b0 - SFX
803bd180 - music
	call stack:
	80270970 [480128E5] - no effect if NOP'd
	802713F4 - NOP kills all sound (was 4E800021 "blrl")
		"branch to link register and link", ie tail call
		changing to just blr freezes the game
		this is a computed jump (to 80270938) - thread state?
		params:
			r0: unused
			r1: 803f8040 - stack pointer
			r2: 803e6500 - many floats which do nothing?
			r3: first argument; seen: 1, 0x28, 0x2D
			r4: 0xB4B4, 0x6464, 0xACAC...
			r5: unused (overwritten with 803c0000)
	80271508
	802830F0
	802846E8
	8024FD3C
	80243F60
	802461AC
	80336E88
	80246B28
	8004A9F8
80270afc [41820034] - NOP here prevents any new sound effects from playing.
	maybe checking if volume > 0, but restoring the opcode doesn't bring them back
	before that it's getting a byte from 0x8139edbc + 0x120 (0x8139eedc) and checking if it's 0xFF
	if so, it takes the branch

the SfxBinEntry structure is something like:

u8  baseVol2;

u16 randVals[6]; //actual sound to play (not same as SoundId)
u8  randTbl[6];  //chance to pick each sound
u16 randMax;     //sum of randTbl
u8  unk1E; //iiii a??b
	//iiii: index into sfxTable_803db248
	//a, b: unknown
u8 numIdxs : 4; //number of items in randVals/randTbl
u8 prevIdx : 4; //previously played idx

to play a sound:
look up the entry with the desired ID
if entry->numIdxs == 0, don't play

if the ID is 0xAB:
	//no idea what this is, just some kind of whoosh or creak.
	//it alternates between two different sounds every time it's played.

	entry->prevIdx ^= 1
	idx = entry->prevIdx
else:
	n = rand(1, entry->randMax)
	idx = the index of value n in entry->randVals
		//eg if randVals = [10, 20, 30] and n = 22,
		//then idx = 2, since randVals[2] >= n

	//avoid playing the same sound twice in a row.
	//if we chose the same one as last time, use the next one.
	if entry->prevIdx == idx:
		idx += 1
		if idx > entry->numIdxs: idx = 0

entry->prevIdx = idx
outId = entry->randVals[idx]
if outId is 0, don't play

compute the volume:
	if entry->volumeRand == 0:
		outVolume = entry->baseVolume
	else: outVolume = rand(
		entry->baseVolume - entry->volumeRand,
		entry->baseVolume + entry->volumeRand)

	//same calculation here, but result is cast to float.
	maxOfs2 = entry->vol2Rand
	if entry->vol2Rand == 0:
