HITS.tab is u32 offsets into HITS.bin
size is next offset - this offset
indexed by field 0x6, 0x8 of TrkEntryMap, which appears to be just the block index
these fields are named trkBlkTabMax, trkBlkTabEntry, so this must be from TRKBLK.tab
entries are 0x14 bytes

player terrain interaction types:
FF: normal (no interaction, or blocked)
0: climb ladder
4: jump up to ledge
5: climb up short ledge
6: push a block
7: jump off a ledge
8: drop down off a ledge and hold on with left hand
9: climbing wall (or climbing up/down onto it)
B: crawl into a tunnel
C: nothing? can walk around
D: shove something away

messing with block at 0x0152D0
which is the hitbox responsible for letting you jump up the ledge at the edge of TTH (around -6713, -762, -3372)
the offset is 0x50 + 0x812fd940 which is where it's loading the appropriate chunk of HITS.bin at the moment
byte 0C [00]: any change = can no longer jump up
0D [2F]:
	00: can't jump up
	2E: can jump up
	20: you kinda float up
	10: weird float up through the ledge
	3F: you jump up past the ledge, gripping the air, and sinking down to the ledge
	4F: can't jump up
	47: can't jump up
	43: can't jump up
	40: same as 3F
	this byre seems to be height or something
0E [8E]:
	00: you float up through the ledge again
	FF: can't jump up
	BF: can't jump up
	9F: can't jump up
	91: can't jump up
	80: you jump up slightly above it
0F [06]:
	00: can't jump up
	05: can't jump up
	07: can't jump up
	FF: can't jump up
	seems like mask 3F is "# funcs"
	46: can't jump up
	86: no change
	C6: can't jump up
	0x11 has a special meaning but again, can't jump up
10 [FFFF]:
	0000: can't jump up
	FFFE: no change
	FFF0: no change
	FF00: no change
	8000: no change
	7FFF: no change
	0001: can't jump up
	00FF: no change
	007F: no change
	003F: no change
	001F: no change
	000F: no change
	0007: no change
	0003: no change
	0002: no change
12 [0000]:
	FFFF: no change
	1111: no change

these blocks are involved with intersectPoint
they're not so much boxes as lines

probably there isn't a direct mapping between these settings and how the player responds to the line. instead there would be flags like "can player pass this", "should player do something when passing this" etc, and what to do will depend on the situation. eg if "can pass + should interact" and it's a short wall, we climb; a high wall, we jump up; a cliff, we jump down...

the map also has hit poly meshes and poly groups which probably define things like "is this a ladder", "what sound does this make when you smack it with the staff", "does this hurt to touch..."
even the shaders could potentially define interactions?

judging from some of their placements, some are also likely meant to only affect enemies, eg to stop them from chasing you into the water or straying too far from their origins, especially if it would cause them to follow you off the map

entrance to shop: (climbable)
flags 00 0004
type roughStone
hit below: 00 62 80 03 -1     0
above 1:   28 28 0E 01 -1  1280
above 2:   28 28 0E 01 -1 16384

toward LV (climbable):
flags 00 0004
type roughStone (centre), stone (edges)
hit below: 00 52 80 83 -1 0

near queen area: (jumpable)
flags 00 0004
type stone
hit below: 00 2F 8E 06 -1 0
above:     28 28 0E 84 -1 0

ladder to sewers:
flags 00 0000
type wood
hit below: 00 95 8E 0A -1 0

812f70f0 is hitline for climbable wall leading to shop
unknowns: 00 62 80 03
first byte:
	77: I can climb seemingly infinitely into the air past the top of the wall (left/right movement is still limited). can't go down through ground.
	01: I can climb to the top of the cliff above
	02: into the sky again - might be a poly idx or hitbox idx?
	I can't climb forever this time; after a while I stop, climb up onto a nonexistent ledge, and warp back down to the ground.

second byte:
	00: can't climb up, and invisible wall obstructs the entrance
	61: no change
	52: can't enter; will climb up to the ledge before actually reaching the top, then sink back onto the wall and resume climbing.
	72: climb slightly beyond the top
	so these two bytes are the climb height, or maybe a general height value for the line
	the latter makes sense being right after the coords
	you can define a plane in 3D space as two points and a height, if you don't need it to be angled
	though, you could also just use two points... maybe this simplifies the math

third byte:
	00: climb halfway up
	7F: can't climb or enter
	40: climb halfway up
	FF: can't climb or enter
	81: can't climb or enter
	C0: no change
	82: can't climb off at top
	83: can't climb or enter
	84: can't climb off at bottom
	88: can't climb off at top
	90: no change
	F0: no change

fourth byte:
	00: can't enter or climb
	01: "
	02: "
	04: "
	05: "
	06: " (this is the value used for some jumpable walls)
	0A: works as a ladder (slide option, can't move left/right)
	so this is the type, but doesn't match up with player interact type
	83: no change
	F3: can't enter or climb
	43: can't enter or climb
	so probably only the highest bit has different meaning

types seem to be:
	01: impassable, but not always? eg the ones lining the river have this too
	03: climbable wall
	04: can jump off ledge
	05: ? found in air
	06: can jump/climb up to ledge (depends on height)
	0A: ladder
	0E: tunnel
