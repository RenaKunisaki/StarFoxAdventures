1. Is the timer from when you hit the fireblaster switch to when the first wind particles appear always the same, or can it vary by what it starts at/how much it counts down by each frame?
2. Do the same number of wind particles appear each time (is it hard-coded), and do they always have the same starting position?
3. Is there any randomness affecting where the wind particles end up/their velocity, or is this also static?

bits for statue switches: 672, 673, 674, 675
lever that activates puzzle: EDF=1, 671=0
	EDF: if != 0, statues can be activated
during scene: 66E=1, 66F=1, 66E=0, 66F=0, 670=1, 670=0, 9F5=1, 9F5=0
671 is checked in DFP_RotatePuzzle::init
EDF=0 on completion and on start, 1 while init
9F7=1 on completion if map act is 1
msg 1 is sent to DFP_RotatePuzzle to initialize it (create objects)
66E, 66F, 670, 9F5 correspond with
672, 671, 674, 675 somehow
the former are "is active" and the latter is "activate"
there's also references to activate+5, so 677, 678, 679, 67A

objects:     DLL  desc
DFP_FireHit  012A invisible hitbox following the torch
DFP_LevelCo  0229 generic level control object
DFP_ObjCrea  022A the water creator
DFP_RotateP  0232 the platform with the torches on it
DFP_Statue1  0233 the statue itself
DFP_WaterHi  012A the water falling from the statues
DFP_TargetB  0235 part of block pushing puzzle (not relevant here)
DFP_blockwa  012A part of block pushing puzzle

so the relevant DLLs are:
012A (CFCrate - many things - renamed to InteractObj12A)
0229 (DFP_LevelCo)
022A (DFP_ObjCrea)
0232 (DFP_RotateP) - handles rotating, timer, checking if fire is hit
0233 (DFP_Statue1)

when the WaterHi(tbox?) collides with the correct-colored FireHit, the flame goes out
the water can hurt you too and the fire can block your shots
on act 1 the rotation speed is fixed (30 units per tick); on act 2 it increases by 1 for each torch you hit (30, 60, 90 units per tick)
the torch goes out whenever it's hit by the water
the fadeTimer field of the water object is repurposed as the color for act 2; it's ignored for act 1
hitting the switch activates the statue for 150 ticks which should be 2.5 seconds
this seems to be not directly done by the switch though, the object receives a message from somewhere
should hack the objmsg functions to log who sends what where
