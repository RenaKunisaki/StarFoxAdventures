Looks like there are 5 tiers of drops:
1: MagicDustSm, MagicDustMi, MagicDustLa, MagicDustHu
2: MagicDustLa, MagicDustHu
3: Apple, EnergyEgg
4: Apple, MagicDustSm
5: EnergyEgg
6: MagicDustMi, ?, EnergyEgg, MagicDustMi, special
Tiers 2, 4, 5 are defined but not used.

"special" is some case where it moves a previous drop?

Each baddie that's capable of dropping loot flips a coin on death to determine if it will drop something. What it drops is specific to each individual baddie. They can drop up to 3 items at once, from tiers 1, 3 and 6.

There's also some logic to override the drop type.

(drops & 0xF000): index into tier 3
(drops & 0x0F00): index into tier 1
(drops & 0x00FF): index into tier 6
Each index can be 0 to mean nothing
