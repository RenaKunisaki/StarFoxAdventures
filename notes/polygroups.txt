let's mess with a polygroup in animtest
block 6.1 loads at 811615c0
the tri closest to the wall is in group 3, offset 0x69C
+ 0xE (first unknown field) = 0x6AA

Offset	0x00069C
Idx	3
ID	0x00
1stPoly	9
X	0 - 153 (153)
Y	-22 - -22 (0)
Z	0 - 640 (640)
Flags	0x0004
Unk0E	0x0000
Unk11	0x00

testing with no sound for now

0E [0000]:
	1111: no change
	EEEE: no change
	0101: no change
10 [0000]: "id"
	1111: no change
	EEEE: no change
	0101: no change
	the second byte is actually the surface type:
	00: bottom of rivers, OoB trees (probably "no special effect")
	01: grass
	02: sand
	03: snow
	08: instant death (DragRockBot)
	09: ice platform? cannon guy stands on it in IM
	0D: ice (slippery)
	0E: water - makes a splash when hit with staff
	10: gold (CRF mine entrance)
	12: rough stone
	13: magic cave floor/wall
	18: wood
	19: stone (including hot stone in DIM)
	1A: lava
	1B: ice wall
	1D: conveyor belt
	21: ? seen in Arwing levels
	22: metal

12 [0004]: "flags"
	0000: no change
	FFFF: it seems to be slightly higher. we can fall through it if we approach from certain angles.
	0001: no change
	00FF: similar to FFFF but we fall through easier
	FF00: no change
	7F04: no change
	8004: no change

let's try changing the polygon itself (offset 0x734)
06 [1F03]: "id"
	0000: we fall through
	1F00: similar effect to above fall-through
	1F0F: no change
	1F0C: same as 1F00
	0003: same as 1F00. we can land on it if we fall from high up, even though our Y coord is still 127.
	FF03: no change
	7F03: no change
	1003: fall thru
	0F03: no change
	1E03: partial fall thru
	1103: partial fall thru, but different spots
	1703: again different spots
interestingly this is never read! lolbreakpoints
