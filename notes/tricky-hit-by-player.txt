to make him attack you:
1) hit him
2) within 3 seconds, hit him again
3) within 13 seconds, hit him 3 more times; each hit gives you another 10 seconds
4) the 5th hit pushes the timer past 3000 (50 seconds) and triggers an attack
	- at this point the timer is divided by 2
	- if he's in water or doesn't have Flame he won't attack, but timer is still divided by 2
5) the timer will be about 1500 (25 seconds) when he attacks; within that time another 3 hits will trigger another attack

while pissed off, he won't obey commands
(actually that same flag is for any time he won't obey, like when he's bringing the ball)
feeding him resets
