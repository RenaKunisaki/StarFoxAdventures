WGShrine:           loads animtest
NikTest:            no files (linklevel, mod63); runs out of memory
Rolling Demo:       loads animtest
Kamerian:           loads animtest
Duster Cave:        no files (cloudjoin, mod56); runs out of memory
Diamond Bay:        no files (dbay)
Discovery Falls:    loads animtest
Willow Grove:       loads animtest
Old KP:             works (should change warp point to be right on the teleporter)
CloudRunner Race 2: empty
Dragon Rock Bottom: works

things we should try:
- copy the files from "Copy of swaphol" into a used dir in K/U0
	- or just swap the dir with swaphol in K

check for non-empty versions: insidegal, dbay, dfalls, linklevel, swapcircle
- demo has insidegal (mod38), linklevel (mod63), swapcircle (mod22)
- also has cloudtreasure (mod23), frontend (mod30)

final version's mod files are modxx.tab, modxx.zlb.bin
K has multiple (.bin, .zlb.bin, .lzo.bin)
should investigate which are used
there's also .blk in the root

why is there both desert and dragrock? looks like desert is actually OFP

kiosk animtest has some extra mod files: .lzo.bin, .tex
many have multiple copies in different formats

kiosk also has different files under card, musyxbin

do romlist files store objects' coords as world pos? so we could infer the location on the grid if a map is missing...
no, they don't.

v1.1 has some dirs in the root that are partial copies of ones in gametext
starfox.h.bak might actually be correct IDs
E0 has audio/dataMusic.bin, Sfx.bin, Streams.bin
	also has some of those gametext dirs copied but they're empty
J1 and E1 also have BUG_cannon_fall
E1 has another: Bug4

save1.bin size=3952 (0xF70), others=1772 (0x6EC) (the size of one save slot)
3952 isn't enough for 3 slots, though
the rest is just zeros

if we want to try swapping unused romlist files into animtest we need to edit the romlist size field in its entry in MAPS.bin or wherever that was
but even then it seems to not care, no additional objects are loaded
same if I hook into the loading routine and change which romlist it loads
it just seems to ignore the file
