# Geometry - Python Geometry Package

Version: 0.0.23

Geometry is a python package for performing computational
geometry. Starting with the humble point, the package implements
increasingly higher dimensional objects: ellipses, circles, lines,
segments, rays, triangles, rectangles and rudimentary support for
working with graphs.

It's also a personal exercise in learning how to provide a high
quality python package:

- robust and complete operator implementation 
- rich setters and getters
- appropriate use of exceptions and exception handling
- designing useful base classes which are easy to subclass
- high quality documentation
- unit tests to confirm promised functionality

Mostly though, it was super fun to write.
