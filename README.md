Reverse engineering notes for SFA

All work here is being done on USA v1.0. `GSAE01.map` is automatically exported from Ghidra and contains symbols found by Dolphin as well as by me.

## Eventual goals

* Play as Krystal throughout the game
    * Reimplement two-character mechanic
* Rip sound effects, textures, models
* Replace models?
* Find any interesting hidden goodies
