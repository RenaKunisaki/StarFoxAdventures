This build has a lot of functions that still generate N64 RSP display list commands
In a background thread it parses these and sort-of high-level "emulates" (to use the term very loosely) the RSP

It implements the vertex cache and segmented addressing the N64 uses, with 16 segments and 64 vertices.

It seems to be F3DEX2 but with some extra commands:

01.nn.cc aaaaaaaa store vtxs to cache
	cc >> 1: cache idx
	nn: number of vtxs
	aa: RSP segmented source address

05aaaaaa ........ draw triangle from vtx cache
	same as 06 but second word is unused

06aaaaaa bbbbbbbb draw 2 triangles from vtx cache
	aa, bb each specify 3 7-bit vtx idxs:
	..333333 32222222 1111111.

BEEFDEAD xxxxxxxx matrix related

D7...... xxxxyyyy set two floats that seem to never be used
	xx, yy: value 0..65536 = 0.0..1.0

D9...... xxxxxxxx set cull mode and Z params
	00000001 enable Z update and compare
	00000600 cull mode

DAffffff xxxxxxxx load some mtxs from addr xx
	ff: flags
		0002: overwrite instead of concat dest mtx
		0004: reset perspective mtx first
	xx: RSP segmented addr
	this clears the "force matrix" flag of command DB0C

DBccxxxx yyyyzzzz some sub-commands by cc:
	00: print "G_MW_MATRIX" and do nothing else
	06: set segment (xxxx >> 2) base to yyyyzzzz | 0x80000000
	08: set some floats using yyyy somehow
	0C: load some matrix and force subsequent vtxs to be drawn with it (only those drawn from cache)

DC....cc xxxxxxxx set some matrix by subcommand cc:
	00: print "G_MVO_LOOKATX"
	02: print "G_MV_MMTX"
	06: print "G_MV_PMTX"
	0E: set a mtx ptr to RSP segment addr xxxxxxxx
	18: print "G_MVO_LOOKATY"

DEADBEEF xxxxxxxx set texture mtx addr for FACEFEED
	xx: address (NOT RSP segmented, just raw pointer)

DEAFFADE xxxxxxxx init TEV

DF...... ........ clear isTexMtxLoaded

E4xxxyyy ..XXXYYY ........ sssstttt ........ SSSSTTTT
	draw a texture over the screen
	coords (xx,yy) to (XX,YY)
	texcoords (ss,tt) to (SS,TT)

ED G_SETSCISSOR

EF...... xxxxxxxx G_RDP_SetOtherMode
	xx is flags:
	0010: compare enable
	0020: update enable
	0800: blend mode
		if set, (flags & 0x03030000) must != 0,
		(flags & 0x0C0C0000) must != 0,
		sets blend mode 0, 1, 0, 5
	if clear, sets blend mode 1, 4, 5, 5
	presumably this is approximating some real N64 command

F6aaaaaa ..bbbbbb G_FILLRECT
	draw 2D rect using previously set color
	x1 = (bb >> 10) & 0x03FFF
	y1 = (bb >>  2) & 0x3FFFF
	x2 = (aa >> 10) & 0x03FFF
	y2 = (aa >>  2) & 0x3FFFF

FACEFEED xxxxxxxx start using texture mtx given by DEADBEEF

FB...... rrggbbaa G_SETENVCOLOR
FC G_SETCOMBINE
FD...... xxxxxxxx G_SETTIMG
	xx is a pointer, not segmented

FEEDFACE xxxxxxxx reset TEV
