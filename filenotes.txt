hex
01 starry background, green stuff in corner
02 nothing
05 changes the lighting
10 nothing if loaded from title menu
	but pressing Start loads C6 which is the pause menu
	this is the actual "in-game" mode
34 title screen menu
35 save file select
36 Enter Name (for new file)
	this will actually overwrite your save file
37 options menu, audio menu, language menu
39 blank, but pressing A loads file 10 which is a map select
	you can select a map and immediately die

loading game:
1e8
259
79
c8
12b
e9
42
143
1e9
1f6
1e9 several times
1ea
1f6
1ab
1ec
20
c6 several times
1f5
e5 or e2 I missed it
5a
e5
4c
and then we have the opening cutscene.

80339d40 "This is not the Memory Card with which you began the game"
this seems to be the currently displayed text
80e50bd2 is the actual message and others
or 8052ff9a, it moves around
nothing ever reads these though (lol memory breakpoints don't work)

8026140C __CARDVerify
inserting a blr (4E800020) here bypasses this check
code: 0426140C 4E800020
BUT using this when starting up the game results in it erasing the file.

MAPINFO.bin is a list of map names and offsets of something. each entry is 0x20 bytes:
0x1C bytes name (null terminated)
0x01 bytes map type
0x03 bytes ???

040559C8 60000000 - enable LOAD PASS/FAIL messages for every object
043A31D4 FFFFFFFF - enable all "cheats" (music test, sepia, dino language, show credits)
0407EEF4 60000000 - bypass save file checksum

on title screen:
cardCb_8025de84  - just wakes up a thread
cardFn_802608b0  - returns pointer to the game code and title
cardReadFn_80263948
    cardReadFn_80263800
gameText 0x497 = "The Star Fox Adventures saved game on the Memory Card in Slot A is corrupt.  You must delete it before you can save."
0x4C7 = "This is not the same Memory Card on which you created your initial save game."

sound IDs:
0x72 rain?
0x286 camera turn behind player
0x2CB Krystal grab ledge
0x2D0 Krystal fall scream
0x398 Krystal climb up
0x3CD Krystal roll 2
0x3CE Krystal roll 1

MODELS.tab is just a list of model offsets, but the highest 4 bits are some flags.
I think they say which file to get the model from.
10000000 10000140 1001A5E0 1001A7C0

MODELS.bin contains FACEFEED structures which are:
0x00: 0xFACEFEED
0x04: decompressed size
0x08: offset to ZLB data: (this * 4) + 0x28 + start of structure
    usually 0xC (points to ZLB *data*, not header)
    this is wrong...
0x0C: compressed length - 0x10
0x10:
0x14:
0x18: relates to MODELIND - maybe submodels?
0x1C: maybe # animations?
0x20: copied to ModelData field 0x84
0x24: ZLB archive
no idea the purpose of repeating this information when the ZLB header already has it...

they can also be this structure for non-compressed models:
0x00: 0xE0E0E0E0
0x04: size
0x08: data offset: (this * 4) + 0x18
so I guess the purpose is that the size/offset are here for both compressed and uncompressed models.

MODELIND.bin seems to be a lookup table translating model IDs to different IDs.
it loads 8 bytes at a time but it looks like only 2 bytes per model; it might be that loading the file has a minimum data size of 8.

some map coords:
gamefront       -18870.4    9.75    28360.4
hollow          -5552.31    -780.94 -3281.25
shipbattle      -18878.5    13      28456.2
krazoapalace    12366.6     211.06  85.8501

WARPTAB.BIN is 16 bytes per entry:
    vec3f coords
    short mapFlagIdx, rotX;
many entries are all zeros
there are 0x80 entries
8035f458 is ptr to WARPTAB.BIN in memory
