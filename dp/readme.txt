When opening this zip, you should see "rom" and "rom_crack.z64". The "rom" file
is the original ROM which was extracted and preserved from the disc. "rom_crack.z64"
is a modified version which will allow the game to be played on emulators and flashcarts.
This is due to Rare's notorious dev cart protections.

We purchased this disc containing the build from a private collector in game Sweden. The 
file date lists the build as being from December 1st 2000. It seems to be quite a late build 
of the game which is great, but it will need some hacking to be fully playable to the end.

Note: The game will currently not run 100% perfectly on any emulator. Expect many graphical 
issues with shadows and lighting, and some slowdown. It should however, work perfectly fine with flashcarts.
