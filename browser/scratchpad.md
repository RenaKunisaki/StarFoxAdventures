should change things to not reply on `app` as much
some things should only rely on `game`
then it would be possible to have multiple Game instances at once for comparing and etc

need to fix the error when loading an ISO but no save, in the save info tab
and the one when loading a wrong ISO file

should replace various instances of Error with custom objects so they can be caught
