<!-- This is exported from Ghidra and then tidied up by hand.
Order is important here.
The reasons for using this system are:
1) Easyish export from Ghidra
2) Automatic generation of the weird hack for structs with offsets
3) Possibly ability to use the info elsewhere
Whether this is sane is debatable.
